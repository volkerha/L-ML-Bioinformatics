This program ranks kmers according to a combination of occurence ranking and entropy.
It can be executed by typing "python HW2.py <parameter k> <parameter R>", where
k stands for the length of k-mer and R for the number of highest ranked k-mers,
which are used to perform PCA. The PCA plot is saved as "fasta_plot" and the ranking
text file as "ranked kmers".

Be aware that the fasta files have to be in the same directory as the python file.
