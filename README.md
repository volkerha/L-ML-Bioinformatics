# L-ML-Bioinformatics

## What is this?
Contains homework submissions for a Machine Learning/Bioinformatics course I did during my exchange semester at Seoul National Univ.

## What does it do?
It's an implementation of different algorithms we learned throughout the course. Mainly k-nearest-neighbor (knn) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to find connections between protein sequenes.
